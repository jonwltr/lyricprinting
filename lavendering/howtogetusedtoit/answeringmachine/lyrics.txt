can you still hear this? i hope no one's out there [newline]
my heart feels empty it's contagious i swear [newline]
so keep your distance i don't need the company [newline]
or watch as i hurt everything around me [newline] 

[wipe] 
a hundred thousand pins and needles [newline]
pierce inside my vacant chest [newline]
they only stop when i'm asleep [newline]
i need a couple years to rest [newline]
i have these thoughts of self-destruction [newline]
every single time i blink [newline]
and all the warmth of being nothing [newline]
makes it difficult to think [newline]

the void is calling i'll ignore him [newline]
it's an everyday routine [newline]
he keeps on leaving me these voicemails [newline]
in the ANSWERING MACHINE [newline]
he tells me i should let the stars [newline]
replace my eyes then leave from here [newline]
and i've been close to calling back [newline]
cause every message seems sincere [newline]

[wipe]
this all just sounds far too familiar [newline]
i think i've been here before [newline]
i know i can't repair the damage [newline]
i need you to find the door [newline]
i'm running out of ways to tell you [newline]
i am tired of this place [newline] 
my vision's permanently blurred [newline] 
i'll miss your watercolor face [newline]
[wait]

[wipe]
if i could start again [newline]
then i'd be far from here [newline]
you wouldn't even notice [newline]
i just disappered [newline]
i'd finally destroy [newline]
this feeling that persists [newline]
and maybe best of all [newline]
i'd like to still exist [newline]
